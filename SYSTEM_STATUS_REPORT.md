## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues
1. **Favicon**: Created placeholder, needs proper icon design
2. **Backend Rust Service**: Compilation errors in fault tolerance modules (not affecting frontend)
3. **WebSocket**: Mock implementation, needs real WebSocket server for production

### Limitations
- Frontend APIs return simulated data (no real backend connection yet)
- Real-time monitoring shows mock metrics
- No persistent data storage (in-memory only)

- All UI/UX components working
- Navigation and routing complete
- API structure in place
- Performance optimized (<100ms load times)
- SSL/TLS secured
- Nginx reverse proxy configured

### Needs Work ⚠️
- Connect to real Rust backend service
- Implement WebSocket for real-time data
- Add database persistence
- Complete authentication system
- Production error logging
