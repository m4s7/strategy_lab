# Story 4.1: Strategy Management Dashboard

**Epic:** Web Interface & Analysis

## User Story
**As a** trader  
**I want** a web interface to manage strategies and view results  
**So that** I can efficiently organize my strategy development workflow  

## Context from PRD

### User Profile: Alex - The Systematic Scalper
- **Information Processing**: Prefers progressive disclosure, gets overwhelmed by complex interfaces
- **Workflow**: Strategy development evenings/weekends with limited time
- **Current Tools**: Custom Python scripts, Excel analysis, manual chart observation
- **Need**: Systematic organization of strategy development workflow

### User Experience Requirements
- **Responsive Design**: Multi-monitor support with drag-and-drop chart arrangement
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Essential features with guided workflows
- **Interactive Features**: Real-time charts and strategy comparison tools
- **Version Control**: Strategy library with parameter history

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and App Router
- **Performance**: Response times under 200ms for standard operations
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live updates
- **Charts**: Interactive visualizations with zoom/pan capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Next.js 14 web application with responsive design ✅ *Implemented*
- [x] Strategy library with version control and parameter history ✅ *Implemented*
- [x] Interactive charts for performance visualization ✅ *Implemented*
- [x] Strategy comparison tools for side-by-side analysis ✅ *Implemented*
- [x] Export capabilities for reports and further analysis ✅ *Implemented*

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Information Architecture
```
Primary Navigation:
├── Dashboard (System overview, quick actions, recent activity)
├── Strategy Library (Templates, custom strategies, version control)
├── Data Management (Source validation, quality monitoring, preprocessing)
├── Backtesting (Single runs, batch processing, live monitoring)
├── Optimization (Grid search, genetic algorithms, result analysis)
├── Results (Performance analysis, comparison tools, reporting)
└── System (Configuration, resource monitoring, logs)
```

### Strategy Library Features
```typescript
interface Strategy {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  version: string;
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
  parameters: StrategyParameters;
  performance_summary: PerformanceSummary;
  tags: string[];
  status: 'draft' | 'tested' | 'validated' | 'live';
}

interface StrategyLibrary {
  strategies: Strategy[];
  search(query: string): Strategy[];
  filter(criteria: FilterCriteria): Strategy[];
  compare(strategyIds: string[]): ComparisonView;
  export(format: 'json' | 'csv' | 'pdf'): ExportResult;
}
```

### Interactive Dashboard Components
- **Quick Actions**: Start new optimization, run backtest, create strategy
- **Recent Activity**: Latest optimization results, strategy updates
- **System Status**: Resource utilization, active jobs, health indicators
- **Performance Overview**: Top-performing strategies, recent improvements

### Strategy Comparison Interface
- **Side-by-side Metrics**: Performance comparison table
- **Overlay Charts**: Multiple strategy equity curves on single chart
- **Statistical Analysis**: Significance testing between strategies
- **Parameter Differences**: Highlight parameter variations between strategies

### Chart Specifications
- **Interactive Features**: Zoom, pan, crosshair tracking, tooltip display
- **Performance**: <500ms rendering for complex visualizations
- **Real-time Updates**: Live streaming of optimization progress
- **Multi-timeframe**: Switch between different time aggregations

## Risk Mitigation
- **Complexity Risk**:
  - Implement progressive disclosure patterns
  - Start with essential features, gradually introduce advanced functionality
  - Provide contextual help and guided workflows
  - Create multiple interface complexity levels (beginner/advanced/expert)

- **Performance Risk**:
  - Optimize chart rendering for large datasets
  - Implement lazy loading for detailed views
  - Use efficient data structures for real-time updates
  - Cache frequently accessed data

## Definition of Done
- [x] Next.js 14 application with App Router implemented ✅ *frontend/app/*
- [x] Responsive design supporting multiple screen sizes ✅ *Tailwind CSS*
- [x] Strategy library with CRUD operations ✅ *frontend/components/strategy/StrategyLibrary.tsx*
- [x] Version control system for strategy parameters ✅ *Strategy library component*
- [x] Interactive performance charts implemented ✅ *Using Recharts*
- [x] Strategy comparison tools functional ✅ *Comparison features*
- [x] Export capabilities (JSON, CSV, PDF) working ✅ *src/reporting/export.rs*
- [ ] Real-time updates via WebSocket integration ⚠️ *Partial WebSocket*
- [x] Progressive disclosure interface patterns ✅ *Cognitive components*
- [x] Performance targets met (<200ms response times) ✅ *React optimized*
