# Story 1.1: Data Ingestion and Validation

**Epic:** Data Pipeline & Processing

## User Story
**As a** quantitative trader  
**I want** to load and validate MNQ tick data from Parquet files  
**So that** I can ensure data quality before running backtests  

## Context from PRD

### User Profile: Alex - The Systematic Scalper
- Individual trader with 6 years of historical Level 1 and Level 2 tick data
- Hardware: 16-core, 64GB RAM Ubuntu server with high-speed storage
- Current gap: No systematic way to validate strategies with full tick datasets

### Technical Requirements
- **Input Format**: Parquet files with Arrow schema compatibility
- **Memory Management**: Streaming processing for large datasets
- **Data Processing**: Handle 7-10 million tick dataset loading in under 2 minutes
- **Memory Usage**: Under 32GB for single trading day processing

### Data Schema Support
```
- level: string (L1/L2 identifier)
- mdt: int8 (Market Data Type 0-10)
- timestamp: timestamp[ns] (nanosecond precision)
- operation: int8 (nullable, Add/Update/Remove for L2)
- depth: int8 (nullable, order book depth level)
- market_maker: string (nullable, market maker identifier)
- price: decimal128[13,2] (price with 2 decimal precision)
- volume: int32 (volume/size information)
```

### Performance Requirements
- Process 100,000-500,000 ticks per second during backtesting
- Handle 7-10 million tick dataset loading in under 2 minutes
- Memory usage under 48GB during large-scale parameter sweeps

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System loads Parquet files with 7-10M rows in under 2 minutes ⚠️ *Not tested*
- [x] Data validation detects missing timestamps, invalid prices, or corrupted order book operations ✅ *Implemented*
- [ ] Support for multiple contract months with automatic rollover handling ❌ *Missing*
- [x] Memory usage stays under 32GB for single trading day processing ✅ *Architecture supports*
- [ ] Error reporting clearly identifies data quality issues with specific row numbers ⚠️ *Partial*

## Technical Implementation Notes
- **Backend**: Rust with streaming data processing
- **Data Integrity**: Checksum validation for Parquet file integrity
- **Error Handling**: Clear failure reasons, recovery options, resource notifications
- **Validation**: Missing data detection and handling strategies

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Quality Risk**: Implement comprehensive data validation and quality reporting
- **Memory Risk**: Implement streaming data processing with memory mapping
- **Performance Risk**: Use memory-mapped file access for efficient large file handling

## Definition of Done
- [x] Parquet file reader implemented with memory-efficient streaming ✅ *src/data/ingestion.rs*
- [x] Data validation system detects and reports quality issues ✅ *src/data/validation.rs*
- [ ] Multiple contract month support with rollover logic ❌ *Not implemented*
- [x] Memory usage monitoring and limits enforced ✅ *src/monitoring/resource.rs*
- [ ] Error handling provides actionable guidance ⚠️ *Partial implementation*
- [ ] Performance targets met (2 minutes for 7-10M rows) ⚠️ *Not benchmarked*

## Dependencies
- HFTBacktest library integration
- Rust project structure setup
- Memory management system
