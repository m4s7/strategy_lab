# Story 3.2: Performance Monitoring

**Epic:** Parameter Optimization

## User Story
**As a** system user  
**I want** real-time monitoring of optimization progress and system resources  
**So that** I can manage long-running backtests effectively  

## Context from PRD

### User Profile: Alex - The Systematic Scalper
- **Time Constraints**: Limited evening/weekend hours for strategy development
- **Hardware Management**: Need to monitor 16-core, 64GB RAM system effectively
- **Process Management**: Long-running optimizations require monitoring and control
- **Resource Optimization**: Maximize utilization of expensive computational resources

### Performance Requirements
- **Real-time Updates**: Sub-second latency for progress monitoring
- **Resource Tracking**: CPU and memory utilization per optimization job
- **Control Capabilities**: Pause, resume, or cancel running optimizations
- **Efficiency**: Prevent system overload during intensive operations

### System Constraints
- **Memory Limit**: 48GB during large-scale parameter sweeps
- **CPU Cores**: Utilize 12+ cores effectively without system overload
- **Storage**: Monitor disk usage for results and intermediate data
- **Network**: WebSocket connections for real-time updates

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time progress bars showing optimization completion percentage ⚠️ *Partial*
- [x] CPU and memory utilization monitoring per optimization job ✅ *Implemented*
- [ ] Ability to pause, resume, or cancel running optimizations ⚠️ *Partial*
- [ ] Live streaming of performance metrics as strategies complete ⚠️ *Partial*
- [x] Resource allocation prevents system overload ✅ *Implemented*

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Real-time Progress Tracking
```rust
pub struct OptimizationProgress {
    pub job_id: String,
    pub total_combinations: usize,
    pub completed_combinations: usize,
    pub current_combination: ParameterSet,
    pub best_result: Option<PerformanceMetrics>,
    pub estimated_completion: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub resource_usage: ResourceUsage,
}

pub struct ResourceUsage {
    pub cpu_percent: f64,
    pub memory_mb: u64,
    pub disk_io: DiskIOStats,
    pub active_workers: usize,
}
```

### WebSocket API for Real-time Updates
```typescript
// WebSocket endpoints for live monitoring
/ws/progress/{job_id}         - Real-time progress updates
/ws/system/status             - System resource monitoring
/ws/logs/{component}          - Live log streaming
```

### Job Control Interface
```rust
pub enum JobControl {
    Pause,
    Resume,
    Cancel,
    SetPriority(Priority),
    LimitResources { max_cpu: f64, max_memory: u64 },
}

impl OptimizationManager {
    pub fn control_job(&mut self, job_id: &str, control: JobControl) -> Result<()>;
    pub fn get_job_status(&self, job_id: &str) -> Option<JobStatus>;
}
```

### Performance Dashboard Components
- **Progress Visualization**: Real-time progress bars with ETA
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk usage charts
- **Job Management**: Control panel for pause/resume/cancel operations
- **Performance Streaming**: Live updates of best-performing strategies
- **System Health**: Overall system status and alerts

## Risk Mitigation
- **System Overload Risk**:
  - Implement resource limits and monitoring
  - Add automatic throttling when resources exceed thresholds
  - Create priority-based job scheduling
  - Monitor system health and trigger alerts

- **Monitoring Overhead Risk**:
  - Optimize monitoring data collection to minimize performance impact
  - Use efficient data structures for real-time updates
  - Implement sampling strategies for high-frequency metrics
