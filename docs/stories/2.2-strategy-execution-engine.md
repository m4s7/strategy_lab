# Story 2.2: Strategy Execution Engine

**Epic:** Strategy Development Framework

## User Story
**As a** strategy developer  
**I want** accurate strategy backtesting with HFTBacktest integration  
**So that** I can trust the results for live trading decisions  

## Context from PRD

### User Profile: Alex - The Systematic Scalper
- **Decision Making**: Requires multiple confirmation points before strategy deployment
- **Risk Tolerance**: Conservative validation approach, needs high confidence before live trading
- **Current Gap**: No systematic way to validate strategies with full tick datasets
- **Business Outcome**: Identify 1-2 consistently profitable scalping strategies

### Performance Requirements
- **Throughput**: Process 100,000-500,000 ticks per second during backtesting
- **Precision**: Execute strategies on tick-by-tick basis with nanosecond precision
- **Accuracy**: Calculate realistic transaction costs and slippage
- **Reliability**: Generate trustworthy results for live trading decisions

### Technical Architecture
- **Backend**: Rust with HFTBacktest library for tick-level simulation
- **Precision**: Nanosecond timestamp precision throughout pipeline
- **Memory**: Efficient processing within 48GB constraints during large-scale operations
- **Concurrency**: Support for parallel execution utilizing multiple CPU cores

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Execute strategies on tick-by-tick basis with nanosecond precision
- [ ] Calculate realistic transaction costs and slippage
- [ ] Track position sizes, PnL, and risk metrics in real-time
- [ ] Generate comprehensive performance reports (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate)
- [ ] Support for both long and short scalping strategies

## Technical Implementation Notes

### HFTBacktest Integration
- **Core Engine**: HFTBacktest library for accurate tick-level simulation
- **Event Processing**: Tick-by-tick strategy execution with precise timing
- **Order Management**: Realistic order fill simulation with market impact
- **Position Tracking**: Real-time position and PnL calculation

### Performance Metrics
```rust
pub struct PerformanceMetrics {
    pub total_pnl: f64,
    pub sharpe_ratio: f64,
    pub max_drawdown: f64,
    pub win_rate: f64,
    pub total_trades: u32,
    pub avg_trade_duration: Duration,
    pub profit_factor: f64,
}
```

### Transaction Cost Model
- **Commission**: Realistic commission structure for MNQ futures
- **Slippage**: Market impact modeling based on order size and liquidity
- **Spread**: Bid-ask spread costs for market orders
- **Latency**: Realistic order execution delays

## Risk Mitigation
- **Accuracy Risk**: 
  - Integrate with well-tested HFTBacktest library
  - Implement comprehensive validation of simulation results
  - Create benchmark tests with known outcomes
  - Add statistical significance testing for performance metrics

- **Performance Risk**:
  - Optimize critical path for tick processing
  - Implement memory-efficient data structures
  - Profile and optimize bottlenecks
  - Design for horizontal scaling if needed

## Definition of Done
