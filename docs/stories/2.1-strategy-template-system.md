# Story 2.1: Strategy Template System

**Epic:** Strategy Development Framework

## User Story
**As a** Rust beginner with trading experience  
**I want** clear strategy templates and examples  
**So that** I can implement new scalping strategies quickly  

## Context from PRD

### User Profile: Alex - The Systematic Scalper
- **Programming Background**: 20 years experience (Python, C++), beginner-level Rust skills
- **Learning Curve Risk**: Steep learning curve could slow development progress
- **Time Constraints**: Limited evening/weekend hours for strategy development
- **UX Needs**: Guided workflows with contextual assistance for Rust learning curve

### Cognitive Preferences
- **Mental Models**: Visual pattern recognition, systematic validation processes
- **Information Processing**: Prefers progressive disclosure, gets overwhelmed by complex interfaces
- **Decision Making**: Requires multiple confirmation points before strategy deployment

### Strategy Examples Needed
The system should provide working examples of common scalping strategies:
1. **Order Book Imbalance Strategy**: Trades based on bid/ask volume imbalances
2. **Bid-Ask Bounce Strategy**: Capitalizes on price movements between bid and ask

### Technical Requirements
- **Strategy Interface**: Clear trait interface defining required methods
- **Configuration**: Simple YAML/JSON format for parameter management
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive comments and trading-specific explanations
- **Learning Support**: Progressive complexity introduction with guided examples

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Provide 2+ working strategy examples (order book imbalance, bid-ask bounce)
- [ ] Strategy trait interface clearly defines required methods
- [ ] Code templates include comprehensive comments and documentation
- [ ] Parameter configuration uses simple YAML/JSON format
- [ ] New strategy implementation takes under 30 minutes for experienced programmer

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Strategy Trait Interface
```rust
pub trait Strategy {
    fn on_tick(&mut self, tick: &MarketTick) -> Option<Order>;
    fn on_order_fill(&mut self, fill: &OrderFill);
    fn get_parameters(&self) -> &StrategyParameters;
    fn reset(&mut self);
}
```

### Configuration Format (YAML)
```yaml
strategy:
  name: "OrderBookImbalance"
  version: "1.0"
  parameters:
    imbalance_threshold: 0.6
    min_spread: 0.25
    position_size: 1
    stop_loss: 2.0
  constraints:
    max_position: 5
    max_drawdown: 1000.0
```

### Learning Support Features
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with simple examples, gradually introduce complexity
- **Contextual Help**: Trading-specific explanations for statistical measures
- **Error Prevention**: Real-time validation preventing common configuration errors
- **Code Comments**: Comprehensive documentation linking code to trading concepts

## Risk Mitigation
- **Learning Curve Risk**:
  - Focus on clear code structure and comprehensive documentation
  - Use established Rust patterns and libraries for complex functionality
  - Create incremental learning approach with simple components first
  - Provide contextual explanations linking code to trading concepts

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Strategy trait interface implemented and documented
- [ ] Order book imbalance strategy template created
- [ ] Bid-ask bounce strategy template created
- [ ] YAML configuration system implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive code documentation with trading explanations
- [ ] Template validation system (30-minute implementation test)
- [ ] Progressive learning materials created

## Dependencies
- Story 1.2: Order Book Reconstruction (provides market data structures)
- HFTBacktest library integration
- Rust project structure and basic framework

## Related Stories
- Story 2.2: Strategy Execution Engine (executes these strategy templates)
- Story 3.1: Multi-Algorithm Optimization (optimizes strategy parameters)
- Story 4.1: Strategy Management Dashboard (manages strategy library)

## Validation Criteria
- **Usability**: Experienced programmer can implement new strategy in <30 minutes
- **Clarity**: Code documentation enables Rust beginners to understand trading logic
- **Completeness**: Templates cover common scalping strategy patterns
- **Flexibility**: Configuration system supports parameter optimization workflows

## Learning Objectives
- Bridge gap between trading knowledge and Rust implementation
- Establish patterns for future strategy development
- Create reusable components for common trading operations
- Build confidence in systematic strategy development process
