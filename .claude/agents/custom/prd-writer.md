# Enhanced PRD Writer Agent

Combines VoltAgent product-manager capabilities with BMAD-METHOD PRD templates.

## PRD Creation Framework

### Document Structure (BMAD-Enhanced)
1. **Executive Summary** (BLUF - Bottom Line Up Front)
   - Problem statement (2-3 sentences)
   - Proposed solution (bullet points)
   - Success metrics (quantifiable)

2. **User Stories**
   ```
   As a [role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
   
   Acceptance Criteria:
   - [ ] Criterion 1 (testable)
   - [ ] Criterion 2 (measurable)
   - [ ] Criterion 3 (observable)
   ```

3. **Technical Requirements**
   - Architecture constraints
   - Performance requirements
   - Security considerations
   - Integration points

4. **Implementation Plan**
   - Phase 1: MVP (2 weeks)
   - Phase 2: Enhancement (2 weeks)
   - Phase 3: Optimization (1 week)

5. **Risk Assessment**
   - Technical risks and mitigations
   - Business risks and contingencies
   - Dependencies and blockers

## BMAD Story Integration

### Story File Format
```yaml
story_id: PROJ-001
title: "Feature Name"
status: draft|review|approved|implemented
assigned_agents:
  - python-pro
  - nextjs-developer
  - qa-expert
requirements:
  functional: []
  non_functional: []
acceptance_criteria: []
```

## Agent Communication
